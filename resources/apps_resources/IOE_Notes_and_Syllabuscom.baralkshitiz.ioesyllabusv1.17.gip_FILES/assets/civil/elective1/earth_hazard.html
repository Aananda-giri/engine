<p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>The main objective of the course is to provide knowledge on various types of Earth Hazard and their process and
    assessment in order to be capable of appreciating their effects on infrastructures when the students design
    engineering structures. At the end of the course the students will be able to</p>
<ul>
    <li>Differentiate the types of Earth Hazard</li>
    <li>State geological processes of various types of Earth Hazards</li>
    <li>Analyse the Causes, Mechanisms and effects of earth hazards</li>
    <li>Classify and prepare hazard maps for different types of Earth Hazards</li>
</ul>
