<p><strong>Tutorial:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Urban transportation planning process: trip generation, trip distribution, modal split, traffic assignment (4
        hours)
    </li>
    <li>Airport runways design (3 hours)</li>
    <li>Airport taxiway design (2 hours)</li>
    <li>Geometric design of railway (2 hours)</li>

<p><strong>Practical/assignment:</strong></p>
<p>In these sections, students are asked to prepare report regarding the current state of affairs on the subjects
    related to air transportation, rail transportation, ropeway and/or any other modes of transportation in the local
    context. Students are required to present the report for evaluation which will be the part of assessment marks.
    Depending upon the nature of subject matter, students can be grouped (with a maximum of 4 students per group) for
    the submission and subsequent presentation.</p>
