<p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>To give students a comprehensive theoretical and practical knowledge of WatSan and hygiene promotion in the different
    phases of emergencies, including disease prevention and preparedness. By the end of the course the students shall be
    able to assess and priorities WatSan needs for a population in the emergency with foresight, and to take appropriate
    measures to prevent and control disease outbreak.</p>
