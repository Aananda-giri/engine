<p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>Groundwater Engineering is the first course in the physics of saturated flow in porous media with engineering
    applications. The course includes topics such as ground-water occurrence and Darcian flow, well hydraulics, pumping
    tests for finding aquifer parameters, overview of methods for groundwater explorations, tube.well construction
    methods and design, pump selection for lifting groundwater and economics of groundwater utilization. Moreover, the
    course gives an overview of groundwater resources of Nepal.</p>

<p><strong>Field visit and project work:</strong></p>
<p>Field visit to any drilling site or groundwater development project in Kathmandu or other areas. Students are also
    encouraged to visit drilling companies on their own to gain practical knowledge on hydrogeology. Also, assignment
    with project works related with ground water modeling is encouraged in the course.</p>
