<p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>This course is aimed at training the students specific engineering design considerations for canal irrigation, their
    operation, maintenance and management with environmental balance and farmer's participation in the hills of Nepal.
    The course is emphasized with the design of non-conventional micro irrigation technology such as sprinkler and drip
    in the remote hills of Nepal. After the completion of this elective course the students will confidently design the
    canal and micro irrigation projects in the remote hilly areas of Nepal.</p>
