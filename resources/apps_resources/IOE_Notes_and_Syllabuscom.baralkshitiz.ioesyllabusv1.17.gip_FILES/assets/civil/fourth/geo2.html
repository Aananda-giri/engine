<p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>To provide knowledge of Engineering Geology to the students of civil engineering and make them to understand how to
    measure the geological data from field for the analysis and interpretation in the development of civil
    infrastructures for their stability and to provide input design parameters.</p>
