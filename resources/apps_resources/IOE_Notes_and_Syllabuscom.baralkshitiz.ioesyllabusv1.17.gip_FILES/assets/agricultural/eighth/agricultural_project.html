<p><strong>Course Objective:</strong></p>
<p>
    This is the continuity of project work assigned to students in fourth year part A.
    The objective of Agricultural Engineering Project work is to provide the
    students opportunity of hands‐on skill development and practical learning
    involving design, development, fabrication, testing and evaluation and
    experimentation on Agricultural Engineering problems pertaining to any one
    specializing areas–Water Management, Soil Conservation and Watershed
    Management, Farm Power and Machinery and Process and Food Engineering.
    The students shall work (at least 4 in a group) under the guidance of a team of
    specialized faculty member/s designated by the Agricultural Engineering
    Department.
    <br>The group of students assigned a task at the beginning of fourth year shall be
    required to complete the task within the due date of the second part of fourth
    year and submit a final project report in prescribed format. Viva‐voce
    conduction and project work evaluation will be done at the end of the semester
    with the help of expert of related field.
