<p><strong>Course Objective:</strong></p>
<p>The survey camp is scheduled after the completion of second year second part theory exam. It has following objective for 10 days incentive field work:</p>
<ol>
  <li>To provide the students real field based exposure to learn and apply different surveying methods in:<br />
    <ol>
      <li>Mapping detailed land features</li>
      <li>Mapping and describing topographical variations</li>
      <li>Planning irrigation, drainage, land farming, soil conservation and watershed management works</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>To accomplish a project based surveying task focusing on:<br />
    <ol>
      <li>Detailed survey of irrigation command area</li>
      <li>Detailed survey of main canal alignment and headwork</li>
      <li>L&ndash;section and cross section of Rural Roads</li>
      <li>Soil conservation and farm leveling works e.g.‐gully control, stream bank control, terracing, bunding, check dams.</li>
