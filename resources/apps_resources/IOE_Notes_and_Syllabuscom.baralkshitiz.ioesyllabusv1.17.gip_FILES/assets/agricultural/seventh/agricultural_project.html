<p><strong>Course Objective:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of Agricultural Engineering Project work is to provide the
    students opportunity of hands‚Äêon skill development and practical learning
    involving design, development, fabrication, testing and evaluation and its
    exploitation on Agricultural Engineering problems pertaining to any one
    specializing areas. At least 4 students shall be in a group for one project and
    each group will be under the guidance of a team of specialized faculty
    member/s designated by the Agricultural Engineering Department. A task at
    the beginning of fourth year shall be assigned to the group. It will be completed
    within the due date. A project report, in prescribed format, requires to submit
    on due date to the department.
    <br>The basic work of Agricultural Engineering Project (Part A) is to expose the
    students to preparation and presentation of technical papers and reports on a
    technical forum, on the issues pertaining to Agricultural Engineering Project
    (Part B) that shall be completed in fourth year part II. In first part of Project
    Work each group of students shall prepare a project proposal. The project
    proposal shall be presented by the group of students in the technical forum or
    department. After presentation of the seminar they will be required to prepare
    and submit a final project proposal to the department.
    Faculty and guest speakers shall be invited to present seminar on topics/issues
    relevant to Agricultural Engineering to enhance the project work.</p>

<p><strong>Evaluation Scheme:</strong></p>
<p>The evaluation of the project work shall be done as under:</p>
