<p align="center"><strong>PROJECT - I</strong></p>
<p><strong>Course Objective:</strong> <br>
To plan a electrical  engineering project under the supervision of an instructor. During the project  students have to design functional project.</p>
<p>Tasks: In the  development of the project each group of students will be expected to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Students will form  a small group (maximum of four  students  per group) projects</li>
  <li>Project concept  development (field selection, hardware/software, scope etc.) , attention will  be paid to the suitability of the project topics for the technical level of the  students and the practical applicability of the subject topics to the local  situation. Wherever possible, projects will include aspect of computer  applications in electrical engineering will be encouraged. </li>
  <li>Perform  literature review and prepare a specific written project proposal including a  clear statement of objective and purpose of the project along with preliminary  methodology, expected outcome,  time plan  and resources estimate.</li>
  <li>Initiate and  maintain contact through regular progress meetings with the initiator of the  project or the immediate faculty supervisor </li>
  <li>At the end of  this semester students will come up with a report with a complete literature  review and final methodology to be adopted with sample analysis.</li>
  <li>End semester  defense</li>
