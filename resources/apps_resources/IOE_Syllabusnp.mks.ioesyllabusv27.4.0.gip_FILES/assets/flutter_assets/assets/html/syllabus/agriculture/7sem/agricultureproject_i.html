</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Course Objective:</strong><br><p align="justify">The objective of Agricultural Engineering Project  work is to provide the students opportunity of   hands-on skill development and practical learning involving design,  development, fabrication, testing and evaluation and its exploitation on  Agricultural Engineering problems pertaining to any one specializing areas. At  least 4 students shall be in a group for one project and each group will be  under the guidance of a team of specialized faculty member/s designated by the  Agricultural Engineering Department. A task at the beginning of fourth year  shall be assigned to the group. It will be completed within the due date. A  project report, in prescribed format, requires to submit on due date to the  department.<br>
  The  basic work of Agricultural Engineering Project (Part A)  is to expose the students to preparation and presentation of technical papers  and reports on a technical forum, on the issues pertaining to Agricultural  Engineering Project (Part B) that shall be completed in fourth year part II. In  first part of Project Work each group of students shall prepare a project  proposal.  The project proposal shall be  presented by the group of students in the technical forum or department. After  presentation of the seminar they will be required to prepare and submit a final  project proposal to the department. <br>
Faculty and guest speakers shall be invited to  present seminar on topics/issues relevant to Agricultural Engineering to  enhance the project work.</p></p>
