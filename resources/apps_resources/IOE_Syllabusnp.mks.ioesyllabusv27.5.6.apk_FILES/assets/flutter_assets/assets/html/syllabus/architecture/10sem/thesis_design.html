<p align="center"><strong>THESIS DESIGN</strong><br>
</p>
<p><strong>Course Objective: </strong><br>
  A thesis in  architecture is expected be a solution of a creative design problem (of a  building complex, a building or elements of a building) that may have differing  focus as seen from the perspective different support courses such as  environment, ecology, energy, design theory, climatology, planning, materials  and technology of construction, services and the like.<strong> </strong>The thesis  aims to demonstrate the students&rsquo; ability and development to pursue analytical  investigations related to the design of a building and/or its cultural, social,  economic, material, climatic, technological, etc. dimensions. It should balance  research and design application components.  It should respond to contemporary  issues in architecture and design. <br>
  <br>
  The thesis design will be as per the  proposal approved in the earlier semester and will be approached on the basis  of research outcomes thereof. The students will undertake any additional  research and study as needed. It will lead to the following final output:   <br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Design/Drawing  component: Drawings to fully explain conceptualization, development and design  of the approved project. The output will be in form of presentation drawings.  The drawings shall at least pertain to site and layouts, plans as required,  four elevations and at least two sections, two perspectives, 3D drawings and  model as necessary to fully explain the concept and design. Students shall seek  prior approval for use of different sizes of drawings. </li>
  <li>Explanatory  Component: The thesis shall also contain a written explanatory section  describing the concept/ design and this section will be illustrated with A4  size schematic drawings of the proposal.   Thesis report shall include the proposal, fundamental research process  and findings, case study analysis and findings as separate chapters. [Size A4  for written, illustrative and explanatory components: Black on white. Sketches  and limited number of BW Photographs]</li>
  <li>Submission  for Department records and study completion: Final of Thesis Report with an  appendix of photographic reproductions of all drawings and Models. <br>
<p>Multi media presentations supplements  may be allowed with permission but this shall not replace the drawings and  models.  </p>
<p>The studio works will be reviewed in following stages of  design exercise:</li></ol>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Conceptual Design:[28 hours]</strong><br>
The first stage of submissions and presentations will be expressions of  ideas and concepts in design and planning for the approved thesis project based  on guidelines and conclusions (points of departures and cautions) from the research  and case studies done in the previous semester or additional studies done  afterwards to meet the demands of comments made during the case study  presentations (ii) make analysis of site for design purpose (iii) think-up some  basic ideas and (iv) apply these together to formulate planning and design  concepts and (v) draw and present the concepts in the form of basic/explanatory  sketches/drawing. Concepts will be produced as &lsquo;presentation drawings and  sketches&rsquo;</li><br>
  <li><strong>Preliminary Design:[28 hours]</strong><br>
At this stage the concepts will be detailed into designs and a  presentation of major aspects of the design shall be made in the preliminary  form with, say, single line drawings in orthographic plans/elevations/sections  or perspectives and/or with simple models in paper, wood etc. – they should  explain the translation of the idea/concept into the design. Review team shall  include at least one internal faculty.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Design Development:[28hours]</strong><br>
Further development of designs shall be made along with sufficient  consideration of form, style, energy, services, structure, construction, safety  and security, etc. and output presented in form of presentation drawings. The  drawings shall at least pertain to site and layouts, plans as required, four  elevations and at least two sections, two perspectives or model and as  necessary to fully explain the concept and design. Review team shall include at  least one faculty from other colleges.</li><br>
