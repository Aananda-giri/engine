<p align="center"><strong>SURVEY CAMP</strong><br>
  Practical : 10 days  (10*13hrs) Field Works</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong><br>
  The main objectives of the survey camp, which is to be  scheduled during third year first part, are as under:</p>
<ol>
  <li>To give the students an ample opportunity to consolidate and  update their practical and theoretical knowledge in Engineering Surveying, in  the actual field conditions and with practical problems.</li>
  <li>To provide the students real field based exposure to learn  and apply different surveying methods, modern surveying instruments, computational  practices and ways of presentation of their final reports.  So, following field works are recommended:</li>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li><strong> Horizontal  Control Practices for Large Area Major Traverse</strong> <strong>:</strong> For this purpose at  least 1.5 km periphery area (not less than <strong>15-17</strong> stations) shall be enclosed by forming the closed traverse and coordinates of  those traverse points shall be controlled with reference to national grid  system. X and Y coordinates shall be controlled by Total Station and Z  coordinates must be controlled by Auto Level. <br>
  <strong>Time Allocated</strong>:  2 Days (Including reconnaissance, stations selection and pegging of major  traverse, minor traverse, major traverse angles, distances measurement etc)</li><br>
  <li><strong>Horizontal  and vertical control for forming minor traverse inside the major traverse : </strong>For this purpose detailed topographic survey shall be  conducted within the perimeter of the semi built up area around 4.0 to 6.0  hectares of land (about <strong>5-7</strong> control  points). Coordinates (XYZ) of these traverses including details shall be  controlled by using Total Station and Auto level. Link traverse exercise must  be compulsory.<br>
  <strong>Time Allocated:</strong> 5 Days</li>

<ul>
  <li>1 Day  for fly  leveling and RL transfer</li>
  <li>2.5 Days  for  detailing in minor traverse</li>
  <li>1.5 Days  for  computation and plotting of traverse</li>
</ul>
<p>Vertical control for control points shall be done by fly  leveling and detailing shall be done by using Total Station and Theodolite.  Data saving in data logger (Electronics field book) and manual booking both  should be practices in detailing.</p>

  <li><strong>Bridge  Site Survey : </strong>Detailed topographic survey of suitable bridge site area  (200m *120m) shall be conducted by which Topographic map, L- section, X section  etc shall be prepared at standard scale.<br>
    <strong>Time Allocated:</strong> 1.5 Days<br>
  Detailing shall be done by using total station. Vertical  control for control points shall be done by auto level.</li>
</ul>
  <li><strong>Road  Alignment Survey: </strong>At least 600m road alignment survey Shall be done from where  plan, L section, X section etc shall be drawn at standard scale including  selection of grades and formation levels etc.<br>
  <strong>Time Allocated:</strong> 1.5 Days</li></ol>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> <br>
As far as possible, number  of students for each group should not be more than 5 (five). For conducting  camp as far as possible modern surveying equipments such as <strong>Total Station, EDM, Auto level</strong> etc are  to be used.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation  Criteria: </strong></p>
<p><strong>For Internal 50 Marks: </strong><br>
  Regular evaluation  throughout the 10 days as well as viva for computation and plotting of major  traverse, minor traverse, viva for road and bridge site survey and traverse  orientation check  should be taken.</p>
<p><strong>For Final 50 Marks:</strong><br>
  Standard Reports shall be prepared groupwise.  During compilation of the report, data shall be submitted contentwise and all  the reference sketches and standard drawings shall be compiled in A<strong>3</strong> size and all the original data and  drawings shall be presented during final viva.</p>
