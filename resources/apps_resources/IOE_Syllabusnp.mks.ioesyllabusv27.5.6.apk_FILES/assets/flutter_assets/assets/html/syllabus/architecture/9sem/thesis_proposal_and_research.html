<p align="center"><strong>THESIS  PROPOSAL AND RESEARCH</strong><br></p>
<strong>Course  Objective: </strong><br>
  To enable  the student to prepare a proposal for design thesis and to plan, undertake and  report on necessary research needed to undertake the design thesis proposed.  This course is prerequisite to course AR 851 listed in Year V Part II. This  course objective needs to be read in conjunction with the following  requirements of Thesis -<br>
  A thesis in  architecture is expected be a solution of a creative design problem (of a  building complex, a building or elements of a building) that may have differing  focus as seen from the perspective of different support courses such as  environment, ecology, energy, climatology, design theory, planning, materials  and technology of construction, services and the like.<strong> </strong>The thesis  aims to demonstrate the students&rsquo; ability and development to pursue analytical  investigations related to the design of a building and/or its cultural, social,  economic, material, climatic, technological, etc. dimensions. It should balance  research and design application components.  It should respond to contemporary  issues in architecture and design. <br>
  The following component of works leading to the thesis has to  be completed in this semester
<ol>
  <li>Thesis topic, project justification and requirement  assessment: The topic of thesis and its scope shall be finalized in  consultation with the assigned thesis supervisor and the thesis supervision  faculty. Requirement assessment shall include space, services, environment,  ecology, energy and other design requirement of the proposed project.  [6 hours]</li><br>
  <li>Thesis proposal: The thesis  proposal must be submitted in proper form for department records and must  include introduction to the proposed thesis, the need and importance  (justification), requirements, fundamental research themes and case studies,  client and site information, expected output of research as well as the thesis.  The submission will be marked. [ 9 hours]</li>
<br>
  <li>Basic Research: This component of  the course will require students to take up fundamental research and literature  review (including architectural standards) on the functional and philosophical  nature of the proposed thesis topic. Research on technological, environmental,  ecological issues may be encouraged.  The  presentation shall be marked by a review team.[15 hours]</li><br>
  <li>Case study: Students should take up cases of similar  exemplary design projects or components of project for detailed study. The  cases may be analyzed from the perspective of form, function and technique.  Studies may be made for all or some major determinants of design such as  climate/sun/wind/rain, materials/their use and behavior, socio-cultural  factors, functional reflections, etc. The presentation shall be marked by a  review team.[15  hours]</li>
