  <p><strong>Practical:  10 days </strong></p>
  <strong>Course  Objective:</strong> <br>
  The  survey camp is scheduled after the completion of second year second part theory  exam. It has following objective for 10 days incentive field work:  <br>
  (a) To provide the students real field based exposure to  learn and apply different surveying methods in:<br>
  (i)        Mapping  detailed land features<br>
  (ii)       Mapping and  describing topographical variations<br>
  (iii)      Planning  irrigation, drainage, land farming, soil conservation and watershed management  works<br>
  (b)   To accomplish a project based surveying task  focusing on:<br>
  (i)        Detailed  survey of irrigation command area<br>
  (ii)       Detailed  survey of main canal alignment and headwork<br>
  (iii)      L–section  and cross section of Rural Roads<br>
  (iv)      Soil  conservation and farm levelling works e.g.-gully control, stream bank control,  terracing, bunding, check dams. <br><br>
