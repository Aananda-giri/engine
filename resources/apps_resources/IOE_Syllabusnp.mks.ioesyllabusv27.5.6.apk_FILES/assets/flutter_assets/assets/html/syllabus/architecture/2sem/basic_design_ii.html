<p align="center"><strong>BASIC DESIGN -  II</strong><br>
  <br></p>
  <strong>Course Objective:  </strong><br>To explore further from understanding the  fundamental principles and elements of design to the development of skill in  solving composite problem which includes different functions, circulation and  construction system related to building design. To understand the development  of design with respect to natural light, ventilation and service system. To  introduce the use of perception in creative design. To employ the above process  for the solution of architectural design and to present through freehand  sketches, drawings and models.<br><br>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Understanding of  Design Standards.(6 hours)</strong>.<br>The students will able to:</li><ol>
<li>Understand and investigate the measurement of human  figure and their movements in space.</li>
    <li>Refer different data sources and standards</li>
    <li>Explore how the basic knowledge of anthropometry is  being utilize in building design.</li>
    <li>Consider the use of light, ventilation and services  system.</li>
</ol>
<br>
  <strong>Exercises-1. (Group work). </strong>
<ol>
  <li>Library research on Anthropometry and Anthropometric  data with reference to international design standards.</li>
  <li>Compare and develop the anthropometric data based on  Nepalese context.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Exercises-2. </strong>   <br>
  Application of  knowledge of anthropometric data to building program formulation through the  study of different activities. Introduction of idea of using natural light and  ventilation.</p>
<p>e.g. Design of own  bed room with an attached bathroom.</p>

  <li><strong>Understanding of  visual perception and transformations of forms.    (10 hours) </strong></li>
The students will  able to:
<ol>
  <li>To get inspiration from the natural object.</li>
  <li>Understand how the perception changes with the change  of colour, background and so on.</li>
  <li>Transformation of one form and shape to another to  create different perceptions.</li>
  <li>To develop ability to design with the inspiration from  nature.</li>
  <li>Develop further skill on freehand sketch, colouring  and model making with the creative use of different materials.</li>
</ol><br>
<p><strong>Exercises-1. </strong>   <br>
  Make three dimensional sketch  of any natural object and transform its shape and form to the level of  abstraction by changing colours, reversing the colour of object and background,  manipulating existing mass and void textures and grains etc. Presentation in  the form of poster by composing series of sketches of transformation.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Exercises-2.</strong><br>
  Make a three dimensional model  from the final sketch with innovative use of materials.</p>

  <li><strong>Developing  abilities to formulate building program to design of architectural space and  composition.(14  hours)</strong></li>
  The students will able to: (utilise most of the  knowledge from previous exercises).</p>
<ol>
  <li>To explore how the basic knowledge of anthropometry is  being utilise in building design.</li>
  <li>To refer different data sources and the standards.</li>
  <li>Discover through exploration of basic principles of  design to apply in own design exercise.</li>
  <li>Consciously (deliberately) manipulate the organisation  of architectural elements like floor, walls, roof etc to create spatial  composition of relative complexity.</li>
  <li>Communicate explicitly in words, drawings and diagrams  the concept of design and the knowledge gained from the case studies.</li>
  <li>Discover through analysis of interrelationship between  the architectural composition and the context (site).</li>
</ol><br>
<p><strong>Exercises-1.  (Group work) </strong>   <br>
     Application of the knowledge of  anthropometric data to building design through Case- Studies e.g. residences,  restaurants, bookshops, showrooms, city service centres etc. </p>
<p><strong>Exercises-2.  </strong>  <br>
       Building design of the similar building  of their case study in a given site.</p></ol>
