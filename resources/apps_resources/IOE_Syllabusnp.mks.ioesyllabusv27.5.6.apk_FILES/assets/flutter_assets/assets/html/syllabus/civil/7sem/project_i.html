<p align="center"><strong>PROJECT WORK – I </strong></p>
<p><strong>Course  Objective:</strong><br>
  The objective of the  project work is to equip the students with skills required to synthesize  comprehensively the knowledge gained during course works for a practical  application of civil engineering discipline in real life. Under the supervision  and guidance of member/members of faculty each student is required to carry out  an individual or group project which provides opportunities for tackling  problem to civil Engineering and is required to submit a project report.</p>
<p>The choice of project will  depend upon the interests of students, faculty and the facilities available in  the campus.<br>
A project may involve:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Preparation of a design for an extensive Civil Engineering  project</li>
  <li>Preparation of a Dissertation involving a literature survey  and a correlation of existing knowledge</li>
  <li>An experimental investigation</li>
</ol>
<p>The project work is divided  into two parts, viz Project –I and Project –II. In Project-I students are  required to complete following works for above mentioned categories of project  works:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Design type project</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Background</li>
    <li>Project Description</li>
    <li>Study Area</li>
    <li>Literature Review/Guidelines etc.</li>
    <li>Methodology</li>
    <li>Field data collection and plotting</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Dissertation type project</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Background</li>
    <li>Need of the research</li>
    <li>Objectives and scope of the work</li>
    <li>Literature Review</li>
    <li>Study area</li>
    <li>Methodology</li>
    <li>Data collection and compilation</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Experimental type project</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Background</li>
    <li>Need of the research</li>
    <li>Objectives and scope of the work</li>
    <li>Literature Review</li>
    <li>Experimental setup</li>
    <li>Methodology</li>
    <li>Data collection and compilation</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>In the initial phase the  faculty may conduct a number of lectures and discussions as to the approach of  the project. In the later phase, the student will be left on his own to pursue  his work and to consult the faculty whenever any problem crops up. He/She  should then submit a draft report prior to the final report so that the  supervisor can correct the mistakes. The final report should be submitted to  the Department Head in duplicate.</p>
