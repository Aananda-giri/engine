<p><strong>Course Objective:</strong> <br>
  To complete an electrical  engineering project Planned in Project â€“ I under the supervision of an  instructor. During the project students have to come up with final output.</p>
<p>Tasks: In the  development of the project each group of students will be expected to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>This will be the  continuation of project-I, start with fulfillment comment(s) in project-I</li>
  <li>Initiate and  maintain contact through regular progress meetings with the immediate faculty  supervisor </li>
  <li>prepare periodic  progress reports for the project supervisor </li>
  <li>carry out such  laboratory or field tests as are appropriate for the project, It is important  to that industry be involved in this area as much as possible to enhance  contacts and provide a mechanism for interaction between university and  industry, and to encourage direct relevance of the projects to real world  situations </li>
  <li>prepare a formal  written report in good engineering style at the conclusion of the project</li>
  <li>present an oral  report to faculty and peers on the results of the project exercise</li>
